        <h1>Time and habits</h1>        
 
    
        <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        <p>I tried the Pomodoro technique and the Fogg Method for small habits
        </p>
        <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
        <p>I found the Pomodoro technique to be the most interesting, it gave
            me the most reward for when encountering and overcoming most tasks
            whether they were big or small. It was a way of finding the focus to
            not be getting in the way of my own priorities at hand.
        </p>
        <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
        <p>The small habits technique I found to work for me, for using it to gain
            a greater insight into how to go about changing larger things in my life.
            The Pomodoro technique I am currently using and finding it to be more adaptable
            and steadily rewarding; this has been excellent at giving the time I've alloted
            more purpose.
        </p>
        <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
        <p>I would like to get more in depth with the Pomodoro technique with the goal of
            being able to provide better estimates on my time spent studying, as well as working.
            This has obvious benefits, the main reason being I can start to feel alot more liberated
            and relaxed with the time spent doing other things.
        </p>
