                A had been blocked today on a problem with not knowing how to tell my computer
                how to use a repetitive action.

                    I used the resources provided with the exercise which gave me the examples.
                    After this I reached out to my cohort in person and got them to point out where
                    I was missing important information.

                    <br>
                    I felt comfortable but nervous, not knowing why something wasn't working. I needed to
                    open myself up to ways of solving my problem.

                        <br>
                        I learnt how to write meaningful code that could be understood well by Javascript,
                        this taught me the emphasis on working through a problem – rather than getting stuck
                        for too long analysing the situation.

                            i had a chance to use this for the first time and I feel confident in using this again

                            this has been my challenge within my bad habit of not being able to finish what i start.
                            I am gaining more confidence in trying something before i give up
                            <br>

                            Rubber ducky method
                            <br>
                            i tried this today for the first time as well and it was an excellent perception opener.
                            i will be using this with confidence next time i require

                            <br>
                            this was very helpful, and i believe that using this within my practice i will only become
                            a better developer. i trust this and remain confident
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Console.logging
                            <br>
                            as is above, my confidence as a developer continues to grow when i can incorporate useful
                            ways of finding solutions without over-commiting to one solution
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            this has been, and will always be something i do when i need to confirm what i might already know.
                            i've started to become more confident in searching through stackoverflow for answers

                            i am comfortable with approaching my peers for support on the tasks that i am unsure about.
                            my goal with this is to be able communicate what exactly i would like to know and then work
                            through together

                            <br>
                            i am very comfortable doing this, although i haven't had to do this since my first couple of sprints

                            this is becoming more important as i become closer to unknown processes and difficult tasks.
                            i want to continue to foster my own learning by giving a slice of my own progress
