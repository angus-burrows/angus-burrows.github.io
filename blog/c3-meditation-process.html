                How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
              <br>
              <br>
                This mindset had a profound affect on my ability to get past blockers that I've had in the past.
                I was able to focus on the priorities of having a responsive site first, before moving onto more
                styling work.

                    I acknowledged that mediation was an important part of having a mindful living. I myself have been
                    practicing meditation on and off for the last 8 years.

                    I've learnt that it creates a connection to your self and well being that is not only constantly changing,
                    but able to help guide yourself through alot of mentally straining tasks.

                        Yes the 2 minute mediation technique has been attractive. I downloaded the Headspace app, which I plan
                        on using at least once a day.

                            I would one day really like to meet Chadeâ€“Meng Tan, he sounds like a profound person to here life
