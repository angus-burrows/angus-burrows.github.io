            <h1>Reflection</h1>

        <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
        <p>My thinking around the whole experience from where I see it as a beginner to this style of learning,
           Is that this not something you enter and then leave. The description and account from Shereef from Dev Boot Camp,
           was put simply; you only get out what you put in. And what he meant by this was you can only be a desired developer
           if you work hard and set your mind to it.
        </p>
        <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
        <p>My impressions so far are that I am both excited and scared. Its exciting to be thrown into the unknown and learn to
           be sustainable while progressing towards a far more long term goal of being a professional web developer. Its scary
           to know that there is no way of guaranteeing full time employment, outside of being a discplined and self motivated individual.
        </p>
        <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
        <p>I see myself being foremost honest and open, and with an open mindset I believe in myself and others to be capable of making the
           the experience not only a greater one, but our own. The ways in which this may develop I am uncertain, but I know that keeping
           focus on lifting everyone up together can only bring more help and achievement.
        </p>
        <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        <p>Yes my expectations have shifted from the surface level, of how am I to obtain a new skill beneficial to my professional life
           to get me where I would like to be in the future, to how might I teach myself and others how to be more applicable in a workplace
           environment outside of Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        <p>I am very excited to be a part of this work environment. I am not afraid to be a part of an environment that is ever changing and
           almost unflinching in the face of adversary, as well as becoming more and more progressive in regards to sustainability and ethics.
