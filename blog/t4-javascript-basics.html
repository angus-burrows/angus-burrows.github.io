 As if talking to a non-tech friend, discuss:

    How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
    Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    Explain what functions are and why they are useful.

              <br>
                Compared to other languages, JavaScript is more complex but offers more control on what you can express with it.
                HTML and CSS are common because they set the foundation for a website, where is JS can make things happen dynamically.

                  <br>
                    To demonstrate control flow you could compare it to checking your email. To check your email requires a set pattern of steps needed
                    to take in order to be successful. Loop in this case would be checking your email everyday.

                        Arrays and objects are both accessed in different ways; with an array you need may only use it if you use it's assigned number.
                        Objects are used by it's name.

                    <br>
                       Functions are tasks that are able to give you information depending on what you need to do. They are useful because of the
                       flexibility they allow in what you want them to do, as you can control them specifically to your needs.
