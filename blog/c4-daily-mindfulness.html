                I learnt that being present and listening with intention brings forward a discovery of new information
                only found when having a conversation. The other person felt rewarded and opened to the idea that
                being mindful when listening and talking was part of being an excellent communicator.

                    I intend to focus on the walking meditation to join my pre-exsiting practice. I had chosen this as
                    my awareness is currently very strong around mindfulness in conversation, so I want to ensure I
                    remember to keep a inward reflective practice ongoing, to sustain and re-energise myself when I am
                    feeling low.

                I am becoming increasingly aware of the balance of the two hemispheres in my brain. My left side telling me
                that conceptual and thematic thinking provides better foresight and planning â€“ where as my right side is
                practice first and reflection afterwards. Learning how to harness these two strengths without blocking myself
                is going to be my own personal challenge.
