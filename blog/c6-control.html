                my triggers are when i am beginning a new task i tend to get distracted or paralysed, this leds to
                anxiety but with no way of releasing it. this also tends to be the case with stopping then starting
                a complex set of tasks.

                    similiar to the box technique that i've been using (breathe 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds)
                    it makes you be reflective and calm on the inside. its also very useful for when you are in a stressful situation
                    as it takes you out of that focus and clears your logical side of your brain.
