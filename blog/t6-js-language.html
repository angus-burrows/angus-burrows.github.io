                In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of:
              <br>
              <br>
              parentheses ()
              <br>
              <br>
                these are used to define a loop. a loop being a string of JavaScript code that defines what you are trying to do
                intially, then is followed by rules that you apply to that action.

                <div class="content">
                  braces {}
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    braces you use after your loop to signify you are opening and closing these set of parameters.

                    single quotes ''

                    <br>
                    single quotes are used to define a string. a string stores a series of characters that are put together to make
                    a name, a place or a word usually
                </div>
                    <div class="content">
                        double quotes ""
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        these are pretty similar to single quotes, but are mostly used for when you have apostrophes in a string.
                        if you were to use single quotes and you wanted to add an apostrophe it could get more complicated.
