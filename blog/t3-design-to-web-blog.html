              <br>
                A responsive site is defined by the way it appears on different screen sizes, a responsive site will behave in a
                way that makes it appropriate.
                <br>
                Responsiveness is important to have your site accessible. If your site is not responsive, then you will not have
                access to it properly from all devices.

                  <br>
                    Mobile first design is where you create the design and structure to work perfectly on a mobile sized screen.
                    <br>
                    This is important for the planning of a website so that you don't run out of options when you add in more
                    content and features.

                        <br>
                        Frameworks are pre-designed and built structures and styles that are used as a placeholder for
                        more specific design.
                        <br>
                        The advantages of frameworks are they provide a fast and efficient way to have a structure in place
                        for your content to be housed in.
                        The disadvantage is you have to eventually go back and change the design to fit the original intent
                        of the site, and to make it more interesting.

                            <br>
                            Wireframes are quick sketches done for the purpose of planning out how a site will be laid out.
                            We use them to organise which parts of the site will be easy and hard. The building of the site
                            can then be created on a list of priorities.

                                    I found it difficult to implement the responsiveness and the consistency of margins.
                                    This was because of my attempt to be have a better practice at understanding how boxes
                                    react to each other. If I come across this problem again I will now be able to fix it
                                    more easily.
