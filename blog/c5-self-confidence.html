      <!-- What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
 Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
 What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section? -->

              <br>
                mindfulness is about setting an intention for every single thing you do, be it breathing or
                gardening. self awareness is the act of listening with intention, where you are submitting yourself
                to full immersion of the thing you are interacting to.

                  <br>
                    In my yoga practice, body scanning is done at the end of a class to give yourself time to think and reflect
                    on how your body is feeling. i enjoy this alot and it makes me feel very relaxed.

                        that the emotions we harbour on a daily basis are going to be different for the days to come.
                        the only true way to be emotional intelligent is to work with yourself rather than only take 
                        control of your emotions
