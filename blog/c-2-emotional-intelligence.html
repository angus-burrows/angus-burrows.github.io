        <h1>Emotional intelligence</h1>
            <h2>
                What learnings did you take from the chapter?
            </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt that being able to use your emotions and focus is the key to acheiving what you desire the most.
                    From this chapter I've learnt to identify where i've been lacking in discpline to be competent in getting
                    the most out of my life.
                </p>
                    <h2>
                        How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            I found it very beneficial, It's easy to forget how much you can ignore your body in order to
                            concentrate on things that can be unforgiving and harsh on your self. It's going to be important
                            for me as a practioner to sustain a steady habit of mediation.
                        </p>
