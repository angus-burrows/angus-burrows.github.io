        <h1>Technical I</h1>
        <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
        </h2>
            <p>
                If building a website is like building a house, HTML is the bare structure, the walls, the doors, windows.
                
                CSS is the aesthetics of the house, the style communicates the purpose and the ideas.

                DOM defines the type of building the structure is. A house, office, apartment etc

                <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
                    <p>
                        To boxify simply means to take every element as they appear in a design document
                        and box them. To box is to organise which area they will be placed on
                        a web page. This establishes framework and heirarchy. 
                    </p>
                        <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
                            <p>
                                The box model is a diagram showing the way margin, border, padding and content
                                affect the area used by a box. The diagram is color coded and shows an example
                                of the exact areas defined by the different boundaries.
                            </p>
