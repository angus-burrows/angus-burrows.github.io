        <h1>Technical II</h1>
        <h2> What is grid based design?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a technique used in design to aid in placing content onto a page.
                It is achieved by forming a grid that sets rows and columns for the content
                to go into. Grids helps establish spacing and hierarchy.

            <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
                <p>
                  The hype is around making the internet accessible from every device.
                  The term responsive means that you can create rules that tell the webpage
                  to change based on what size screen you are using.  
                </p>
            <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
            <p>
                Semantic structure describes the language used when using tags
                and elements in HTML and CSS. A semantic tag is able to tell the user
                what it does without giving detailed description, since it's universal. 
            </p>
            <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
            <p>
                Getting into the workflow and mindset of a developer has been teaching me
                about how to approach new projects and pages. Being able to focus on the 
                function first before going back and fine tuning results is starting to 
                become a good habit for me.
