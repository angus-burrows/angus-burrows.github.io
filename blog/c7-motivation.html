                life looks very different from what is now, the only similarity is the attitude towards learning and motivation.
                Giving a better scope and being descriptive as possible are tools to giving a future more meaningful attraction.
                And these are things that can change depending on who you are as a person.

                              I found this pleasing because of my current stress levels at the moment, It was a very useful exercise
                              to think much bigger than myself and to quietly reflect inwards about the feelings I had been involved with.
                              Thinking about it now, it's been a journey to realise that the ideals and things that I hold closely to myself,
                              are often overlooked.

                                  Doing the writing exercise in which I gave detail into what I want my life to be within five years was very
                                  enjoyable. This is something that i've been meaning to do – but now having it done I feel much more happy about 
                                  it. Giving the detail into a written form was also very telling of my own nature, and how it can be achieved.
